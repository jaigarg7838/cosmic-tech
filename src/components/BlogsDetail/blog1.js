                        <p>
                            The internet is booming, and businesses are getting digital. Digitalization is helping both
                            sellers and consumers. Sellers now don’t need to have a physical store and can reach global
                            consumers. And consumers don’t need to go to physical stores; they can avail services
                            provided by the businesses right from their place of comfort, from their home.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            But modeling a real-life business into software is hard. Let’s take an example of a general
                            store. To set up an online general store, we need to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create an inventory management system</li>
                            <li>Integrate our service with a delivery service</li>
                            <li>Handle payment</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            To ease the development process, programmers from all across the globe are creating several
                            powerful tools, libraries, frameworks, and technologies. WordPress is one such technology.
                            WordPress is a CMS (Content Management System); it is a no-code platform. Anybody without
                            any coding experience can develop a website/web app using WordPress. WordPress websites can
                            be customized by using thousands of free-to-use and paid themes and plugins. A theme in
                            WordPress defines the layout, the color scheme, and overall look and feel of the website.
                            Whereas plugins (plug-ins) are used to add functionalities like payment gateway, newsletter
                            form, etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the other hand, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a language for formatting and styling
                            documents accessible over the internet. HTML websites use HTML, CSS, and JS to build all the
                            functionalities that the website requires. HTML controls the overall structure and layout.
                            CSS is responsible for the look and feel. And JS manages the moving parts. It can change
                            both HTML and CSS. Those who develop HTML websites have an in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS,
                            JS, and an understanding of how all these components work together to make a beautiful
                            website. Several frameworks and libraries like Webpack, ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, etc. have
                            made it easier to work on an HTML website.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            WordPress sounds like a better option, with less hard work required to get a website up and
                            running. But is it always the best option?
                        </p>

                        </h5>

                        <h6>1. Speed</h6>

                        <p>
                            HTML websites are faster than WordPress websites, and they always will be. WordPress stores
                            all the content used on a page (like text, image URLs) in a MySQL database. So, when a user
                            sends a request for the page, WordPress fetches the contents from DB and places the content
                            in its proper place.<br />
                            On the contrary, HTML pages have all the content already filled and in its place. An HTML
                            page is just a static file that does not require any preprocessing before being sent to the
                            user. And this makes HTML websites faster than WordPress websites.
                        </p>

                        <h6>2. Ease of adding new unique features</h6>

                        <p>
                            You can easily change the styles (for ex. font size, style, color) of a WordPress site. But
                            if you want to add some new functionality to your website, for example, a simple calendar to
                            book a consultation call with you, you will need to use a plugin. There are thousands of
                            plugins available, some free and some for a price. You might not always be able to find one
                            suitable for your use case.<br />
                            HTML websites are very flexible since all the code is done by hand any functionality can be
                            added very easily. The catch here is that complex features will take longer to complete,
                            which will increase the development cost.
                        </p>

                        <h6>3. Size</h6>

                        <p>HTML websites are very lightweight around (1MB-10MB), and taking their backup is easy. Source
                            control platforms like git can be used to back up an HTML website. This provides developers
                            the capability to use advanced technologies like docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, etc,
                            which eases testing and release management.
                            <br />
                            WordPress uses PHP to perform server-side rendering of the requested webpage, it contains an
                            admin panel, themes, plugins, and a lot of other components which increases the size of the
                            website (1GB-1.5GB) making backup heavier and a time-consuming process. Although
                            technologies like git, docker, and Kubernetes can be used with WordPress too, the size of
                            the website will increase the build time.

                        <h6>4. SEO (Search engine Optimization) Performance</h6>

                        <p>
                            Both HTML and WordPress websites perform well when it comes to SEO. But HTML websites have a
                            slight advantage. Website load speed is a factor that affects the rank of a listing, search
                            engines want their users to visit websites that have the lowest load time. Due to this HTML
                            websites are better suited for SEO.

                        <h6>5. Development Cost</h6>

                        <p>
                            Since WordPress doesn’t need very high effort development cost is low, typically starting at
                            ₹10000. HTML website requires high effort and take longer to develop, the development cost
                            of these websites is high, typically starting at ₹20000.

                        <h6>
                            6. Maintenance Cost
                        </h6>

                        <p>
                            WordPress websites need regular maintenance, WordPress and other plugin needs to be updated
                            to the latest version regularly. Security vulnerabilities in any plugin or WordPress itself
                            pose a risk to the entire website. On the other hand, HTML websites don’t need any regular
                            maintenance.
                        </p>

                            7. Hosting Cost
                        </h6>

                        <p>
                            HTML websites don’t need a server for hosting. A storage bucket is more than enough to host
                            an HTML website. And when a CDN is used with the storage bucket, the web site's load speed
                            increases considerably. But WordPress website needs a server to host the website. Hosting
                            affects the load speed and overall performance of a WordPress website. The server must have
                            enough RAM, computation power, and network bandwidth to serve your users. This increases the
                            cost of maintenance of a WordPress website.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Which one should you get and why ?</h5>

                        <p>
                            HTML websites are fast, secure, lightweight, and need less maintenance. So in general, if
                            you have budget constraints, you should opt for WordPress, but if you have enough budget go
                            for an HTML website.
